# Exercises - Day 1

### `1_babylonian_sqrt`

You'll consider a short and famous algorithm for approximately computing the square root of a number. For this simple example, you'll learn about the power of *generic programming*, specifically: arbitrary precision, automatic differentiation (AD), and symbolic computation.

### `2_onehotvector`

Here, you'll define your own "one hot" vector type, which has applications in machine learning. You'll get familiar with implementing methods for your type (to make a given algorithm work) and see what can be gained from integrating your type into Julia's type hierarchy.

### `3_Cthulhu`

In this exercise, you will make yourself familiar with the basics of [Cthulhu.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDebug/Cthulhu.jl), a tool to interactively introspect Julia code. No code needs to be written here.
